1. WHAT IS JANE?
================================================================================

Meet Jane — a fully offline, AI-powered virtual assistant that lives entirely
on your computer. No cloud. No subscriptions. No data leaving your machine.

Jane listens to your voice, understands what you want through advanced AI,
takes action on your computer, and responds naturally — all without ever
touching the internet (except when you ask her to browse the web or play
YouTube videos, of course).

She's not just another chatbot. Jane can actually DO things:
- Control your system volume and screen brightness
- Search the web and play YouTube videos
- Open, close, and switch between applications
- Set reminders that speak to you when the time comes
- Have natural conversations and answer your questions
- Understand corrections and undo mistakes

Built with privacy in mind. Powered by local AI.

================================================================================
3. WHAT JANE CAN DO
================================================================================

Jane combines the conversational intelligence of Llama 3 with real system
control capabilities. She's not just answering questions — she's taking
action on your behalf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 VOICE INTERACTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jane is always listening for you — but only when you want her to.

ACTIVATION METHODS:
  - Say "Hey Jarvis" to wake her up
  - Press Ctrl+Shift+J for instant activation (recommended)

SPEECH RECOGNITION:
  - Fully offline speech-to-text
  - Optimized for English
  - Fast transcription (under 1 second for most commands)

VOICE RESPONSES:
  - Natural-sounding female voice
  - Completely offline — no internet required
  - Warm, conversational personality

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 SYSTEM CONTROL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jane can control your computer with simple voice commands.

VOLUME CONTROL:
  "Turn up the volume"
  "Lower the volume"
  "Mute"
  "Set volume to 50 percent"
  "No, the other volume"        → switches between system and browser

BRIGHTNESS CONTROL:
  "Increase the brightness"
  "Make it dimmer"
  "Set brightness to 70 percent"
  "That's not enough"           → keeps adjusting
  "Too much"                    → reverses direction

APPLICATION CONTROL:
  "Open Chrome"
  "Launch VS Code"
  "Close Notepad"
  "Switch to Discord"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 WEB & YOUTUBE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you need the internet, Jane handles it seamlessly.

WEB SEARCH:
  "Search for Python tutorials"
  "Google machine learning basics"
  "Open the first result"
  "Show me the third one"

YOUTUBE:
  "Play Shape of You on YouTube"
  "Search for cooking videos on YouTube"
  "Open the second one"
  "Pause"
  "Skip to the next video"
  "Go back to the previous one"
  "Make it fullscreen"

Jane even attempts to skip ads automatically when possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 REMINDERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Never forget anything again.

  "Set a reminder for 5 minutes"
  "Remind me in one hour to take a break"
  "Remind me to call Mom at 7pm"

When the time comes, Jane speaks your reminder out loud — even if you're
doing something else.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 SCREEN READING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jane can see what's on your screen and help you understand it.

  "Take a screenshot"
  "Read this page for me"           → reads exact text aloud
  "What is on my screen?"           → summarizes the content
  "Explain what I'm looking at"     → provides context and analysis

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 NATURAL CONVERSATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jane is powered by Llama 3, running entirely on your machine.

  "What is the capital of France?"
  "Tell me about machine learning"
  "How are you today?"
  "Thanks for your help"

She remembers context within a conversation:

  You: "Search for cats on YouTube"
  Jane: "Searching for cats on YouTube."
  You: "Open the first one"
  Jane: "Opening: Funny Cats Compilation..."
  You: "Lower the volume"
  Jane: "Browser volume now at 80%."
  You: "No, the system volume"
  Jane: "Got it, adjusting system volume instead."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7 CORRECTIONS & UNDO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Made a mistake? Jane understands corrections naturally.

  "Undo that"                       → reverses the last action
  "No, I meant the system volume"   → corrects and re-executes
  "That's wrong"                    → triggers correction flow
  "The other one"                   → switches targets

Jane keeps track of what she's done and can reverse most actions.


================================================================================
4. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

Jane 6.0 is powerful, but she's not perfect. Here's what to expect:

RESPONSE TIME:
  - AI processing takes 10-22 seconds per command, depending on your hardware
  - First command after startup is slower (loading AI models)
  - GPU acceleration significantly improves speed

WAKE WORD:
  - Uses "Hey Jarvis" — custom "Hey Jane" wake word coming in future update
  - Hotkey activation (Ctrl+Shift+J) is more reliable

YOUTUBE ADS:
  - Can only skip ads that have a "Skip" button
  - Non-skippable ads must play through

BROWSER:
  - Jane's browser profile must be closed before asking her to open the browser
  - Other Chrome profiles/windows can remain open — only Jane's profile matters

SCREEN READING:
  - Works best with clear, high-contrast text
  - Handwritten or stylized text may not be recognized accurately

CONVERSATION:
  - Requires Ollama to be running for AI features
  - Without Ollama, only basic responses are available

PLATFORM:
  - Windows only (macOS and Linux support planned for future)


================================================================================
5. WHAT'S COMING NEXT
================================================================================

Jane is actively being developed. Here's what's on the roadmap:

HIGH PRIORITY:
  ✦ Faster response times
  ✦ Custom "Hey Jane" wake word
  ✦ Streaming speech (start talking while still thinking)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  ✦ Emotion-aware voice (happy, calm, empathetic tones)
  ✦ Voice cloning (make Jane sound like anyone)
  ✦ Clipboard control ("Copy that", "What's in my clipboard?")
  ✦ File operations ("Create a folder on Desktop")

FUTURE:
  ✦ Multi-language support
  ✦ Calendar integration
  ✦ Note-taking system
  ✦ Music player control (Spotify, local files)
  ✦ Smart home integration
  ✦ Plugin system for custom actions
  ✦ Web dashboard for settings and history


================================================================================
6. GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

STEP 1: INSTALL OLLAMA
  Download from https://ollama.com and install it.
  Open a terminal and run:
    ollama pull llama3

STEP 2: START OLLAMA
  Ollama usually runs automatically in the background.
  Look for the Ollama icon in your system tray.
  If not running, open a terminal and run:
    ollama serve

STEP 3: LAUNCH JANE
  Run Jane from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.
  Wait for the greeting: "Hello! I'm Jane, your AI assistant."

STEP 4: START TALKING
  Press Ctrl+Shift+J (or say "Hey Jarvis")
  Speak your command
  Wait for Jane's response

STEP 5: ENJOY
  Try these commands to get started:
    "What can you do?"
    "Search for music on YouTube"
    "Open the first one"
    "Lower the volume"
    "Set a reminder for 2 minutes"
    "What time is it?"


================================================================================
7. TIPS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

  Use the hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+J) — it's faster and more reliable
  Speak clearly and wait for the activation sound
  Give Jane a moment to process — AI takes time
  Use follow-up commands naturally ("open the first one", "no, the other")
  If something goes wrong, say "undo that"
  Close Jane's browser window before asking her to open the browser again
  A dedicated microphone improves recognition accuracy
