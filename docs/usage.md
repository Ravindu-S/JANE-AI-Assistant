## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### JANE Doesn't Respond

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Not activated | Press **Ctrl+Shift+J** or say *"Hey Jarvis"* |
| Ollama not running | Start Ollama from system tray or run `ollama serve` |
| Microphone muted | Check Windows sound settings |
| Microphone permissions | Allow microphone access in Windows Privacy Settings |

### JANE Doesn't Hear Me Correctly

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Background noise | Move to quieter environment |
| Speaking too fast | Slow down and speak clearly |
| Microphone too far | Position mic closer to you |
| Wrong microphone selected | Set correct input device in Windows Sound Settings |

### Slow Responses

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| First command after startup | Normal — models loading, subsequent commands faster |
| No GPU available | Expected — CPU inference is slower but works |
| Ollama restarted recently | Wait for model to reload |
| Complex question | AI needs more processing time for detailed responses |

### Browser Commands Don't Work

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| JANE's browser still open | Close JANE's browser window, then retry |
| Chrome not installed | Install Google Chrome |
| Internet disconnected | Check your internet connection |

### Volume/Brightness Commands Don't Work

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| System permissions | Run JANE as Administrator |
| External monitor brightness | Some external monitors don't support software brightness control |
| Browser volume with no media | Open media in browser first, then adjust |

### Reminders Don't Trigger

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| JANE was closed | JANE must be running for reminders to trigger |
| Time parsing issue | Use clear time formats: *"in 5 minutes"*, *"at 7pm"* |
